# SUDOKU
Here is a basic implementation of a Sudoku game written in Java that uses Swing as the GUI. The game has several Sudoku puzzles, keeps track of errors, and loads the next puzzle automatically when solving the current one.

Features 

Classic 9x9 Sudoku board

Multiple puzzles with solutions 

Input via number selection buttons

Error counter displayed at the top 

Automatically recognizes when the puzzle is completed 

Allows for loading a new puzzle after completing the current one 

We made the 3x3 section visually separated in a different color to allow for readability.
